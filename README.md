# UniChat - Secure End-to-End Messaging System

## Introduction & Context

### Security of Communications

In the digital age, securing communications is paramount to protecting user data from intrusions, interceptions, and leaks. With the increase in personal, professional, and financial exchanges, it's critical to ensure that only authorized parties have access to sensitive content. Traditional server-side encryption methods often fall short, as data can be exposed during transit or while stored on servers. End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) presents an effective solution by encrypting messages directly on the sender's device and only decrypting them on the recipient's device, ensuring both the confidentiality and integrity of communications.

### Project Objectives

The primary goal of the **UniChat** project is to develop practical skills in securing communications, based on knowledge gained from coursework and personal research. The project aims to implement End-to-End Encryption to ensure the privacy of conversations while offering a seamless user experience with real-time messaging features, contact management, and other functionalitiesâ€”all within a secure and robust architecture. This system will continue to evolve and improve over time.

### Technologies Used

To build **UniChat**, a combination of complementary technologies was utilized:

* **Flutter**: Used to develop a modern, responsive, and cross-platform mobile interface.
* **Laravel**: Provides a secure backend structure for user management, authentication, and secure data storage.
* **Pusher**: Enables real-time messaging, ensuring that messages are delivered quickly and reliably between users.

The integration of these technologies ensures a balance of security, performance, and usability in the application.
